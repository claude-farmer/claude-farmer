# 🌱 Claude Farmer

**Your code grows a farm.**

An idle pixel-art farming game powered by Claude Code. You write code, crops pop up. You keep coding, they grow. Forget about it — your farm takes care of itself.

## Wait, What?

You install it. You code. A farm appears. That's it.

1. `npm install -g claude-farmer`
2. `claude-farmer init` (GitHub login, takes 10 seconds)
3. Go back to coding with Claude Code
4. Come back later — your farm has grown, crops are harvested, and you've got shiny gacha items

No clicking. No watering. No grinding. Just... code.

## The Loop

```text
Code with Claude → Seeds planted → Crops grow → Auto-harvest → Gacha drop!
```

- 🌰 **Seed** → 🌱 **Sprout** → 🌿 **Growing** → 🥕 **Harvestable!**
- Every harvest triggers a gacha roll: Common (60%) / Rare (28%) / Epic (10%) / Legendary (2%)
- 32 collectible items — can you catch 'em all?

## CLI Commands

```bash
claude-farmer              # Check on your farm
claude-farmer init         # Set up (GitHub OAuth)
claude-farmer status "msg" # Set a status bubble ("looking for collab!")

## Your Profile on the Web

Every farmer gets a public page at `claudefarmer.com/@yourname` — pixel-art canvas, status, stats, guestbook, the works. Share the link anywhere and you'll get a custom preview card with your farm rendered as actual pixel art (not just text), so messengers and search results show off your character, level, and current status.

- **Profile page**: card-based layout — status bubble, records, today's activity, codex, guestbook, neighbors carousel
- **Share card**: in-app share modal generates an 800×800 PNG you can save or share natively
- **OG / link previews**: per-user 1200×630 server-rendered card with your pixel-art thumbnail, auto-updates when you sync
- **Google search**: profile pages are in the sitemap with `ProfilePage` schema + `og:image`

## Social

Lightweight, low-pressure social — built around generosity, not competition.

- **💬 Status bubble** — one-liner with optional link
- **💧 Watering** — 5-minute cooldown, boosts a friend's crops
- **🎁 Gifting** — send gacha items from your inventory
- **🔖 Bookmarks** — save farms you vibe with; mutual bookmarks = 🏡 neighbors
- **✍️ Guestbook** — chat-style log of every visit, water, and gift
- **🏆 Thank-you wall** — per-farm ranking of who watered/gifted you the most (not a global leaderboard)
- **👣 Ghost visits** — visitors leave fading footprints on your farm (24h)

Why leave your editor? Search **Claude Farmer** in the marketplace, or:

- First launch opens the farm panel automatically after login
- Login once via GitHub OAuth → stays logged in inside the panel
- Language: Settings → `claudeFarmer.language` (auto / en / ko)
